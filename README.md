# Blockchain Legislation 

## Federal Legislative Definition

* A collaboration between law.MIT.edu and the US House on developing [legislative definitions of "blockchain" and "distributed ledger](http://web.mit.edu/blockchain) technologies and systems


## State Legislation

* Nevada (SB 398): establishes various provisions relating to the use of blockchain technology. ([Link to bill](http://digitalchamber.us8.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=a87f67248663abe55ad9325d6&id=b6e5f3e9f0&e=75f1f16748)) 

* Arizona (H B 2417): signatures; electronic transactions; blockchain technology - Signed into law April 3, 2017. ([Link to bill](http://digitalchamber.us8.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=a87f67248663abe55ad9325d6&id=9c9062a046&e=75f1f16748))

## Digital Signatures, Contracts and Transactions

Law defining and governing digital signatures, electronic contracts, automated transactions and other applications of electronic records or processes provides important overarching legal context within which to understand blockchain technology.

### US Federal and Uniform State Law

The legal validity of Electronic Transferable Records was explicitly established in the US through UETA (as uniform state law) and ESIGN (federally), both of which (broadly) were implementations of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce. 

* Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN): [https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-106publ229/html/PLAW-106publ229.htm](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-106publ229/html/PLAW-106publ229.htm)

* In the 1990's, the ABA [Digital Signature Guidelines](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjCn4G43YjUAhWI24MKHUrkBMMQFggmMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapps.americanbar.org%2Fdch%2Fthedl.cfm%3Ffilename%3D%2FST230002%2Fotherlinks_files%2Fdsg.pdf&usg=AFQjCNEADZ1-y4H-hDwiWmoBTE0VyqrBWQ&sig2=STMdXIAbTBy1XKvod4bZQg) provided a conceptual framework for legally understanding and working with cryptographically based digital signatures.  This document provides an excellent overview of how hash digests and public-private key cryptography can be used to legally execute a digital signature, though some of the more speculative content about a possible role of "trusted third party" new models of business to provide "certification authority" functions did not pan out.
